# wordlelm

a wordle clone in elm - WIP

goal is to have a production full featured clone of wordle that can be used to replace https://github.com/pietroppeter/wordle-it

after the current full feature set of wordle we will think about adding features, e.g.:
- play a past game
- history of all your past games
- share a custom game

I am a beginner in both Elm and functional languages.
